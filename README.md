# **Build DJI Ryze Tello Drone Application with .NET MAUI**


Hi, do you use .NET MAUI for application development? With .NET, you can build multi-scenario applications, including traditional desktop applications, cloud-native applications, mobile applications, games, machine learning, IoT, big data, etc. .NET MAUI allows you to quickly build cross-platform applications through C#, and build iOS / Android / Windows / macOS applications. This series combines DJI Ryze Tello to quickly build an interactive application with drones, hoping to become your begninning course for .NET MAUI.

### **You can learn**

1. C# UDP programming
2. Build a DJI Ryze Tello Prototype Using the .NET Polyglot Notebooks Interactive Tool
3. Knowledge about mobile applications develpment
4. Knowledge of .NET MAUI 
5. Build UI with .NET MAUI Comet
6. .NET MAUI binding native library for mobile applications

### **Scenario**

Drones are very popular equipment. In addition to being used for aerial photography, drones can directly assist different industries to complete specific tasks, such as agriculture, wind power equipment maintenance, and STEM education. This series is based on DJI Ryze Tello to complete the construction of related applications.
